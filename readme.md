# React todo app from scratch (raw webpack, no create-react-app).

I did this just to 'practice' a little bit with webpack and all his fancy cool stuff that you can add in like a scss loader or trying some svg convertion.

**Technologies on the project**

- React
- Redux
- Scss
- Webpack
~~Need to add some more stuff...~~
